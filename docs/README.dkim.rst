DKIM
====

`DKIM`_ involves applying a digital signature to every email to prevent email
spoofing. We'll install and use OpenDKIM to sign emails before Postfix sends
them.

.. _DKIM: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail

Choose a domain and a selector
------------------------------

For simplicity, the sending domain should match your Discourse hostname (eg,
``discourse.jamielinux.com``). Login to your **Admin** dashboard and set
**notification email** accordingly (eg, ``noreply@discourse.jamielinux.com``).

Pick a unique **selector** for the key pair. An identifier followed by the
current date works well (eg, ``discourse-20150601``).

Create a key pair
-----------------

Install ``opendkim`` (or ``opendkim-tools`` on Debian). Run ``dkim-genkey.sh``
with your desired domain and selector.

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd files/dkim
    $ ./dkim-genkey.sh discourse.jamielinux.com discourse-20150601

Two files have been created: a private key (``discourse-20150601.private``) and
a public key (``discourse-20150601.txt``). Use the contents of the public key to
create a TXT record. In `zone file`_ format, it looks like this:

.. code-block:: text

    ; 't=y' indicates "test mode". Remove 't=y' once you know DKIM is working.
    discourse-20150601._domainkey.discourse.jamielinux.com. IN TXT (
        "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; t=y;"
        "p=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOC... " )

Add these options to ``group_vars/all/main.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    dkim_enabled:  True
    dkim_domain: "discourse.jamielinux.com"
    dkim_selector: "discourse-20150601"

    # Discourse notification emails will be signed by this private key.
    # Ensure the matching public key has been published to DNS records.

Key rotation
------------

Advice varies on how often to rotate. A 2048-bit key should probably be rotated
every few years. Follow these steps:

#. Generate another key with a different selector.

#. Add a TXT record for your new key, but donâ€™t change the TXT record for your
   old key.  If you retire the old TXT record too early, emails sent before you
   rotated might fail validation.

#. Update the variables in ``group_vars/all/main.yml``. Re-run the playbook to
   rotate to the new key.

#. Wait a couple of weeks and then retire the old key. Empty the contents of
   the ``p`` field from the old TXT record.

.. code-block:: text

   ; This should remain in your DNS records.
   discourse-20150601._domainkey.discourse.jamielinux.com. IN TXT (
       "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=" )

How do I know DKIM is working?
------------------------------

A few services can check for you, such as `port25`_. To receive a report to
``jamie@example.com``, login to your **Admin** dashboard and send a test email
to ``check-auth-jamie=example.com@verifier.port25.com``.

The email report sent to ``jamie@example.com`` should look like this:

.. code-block:: text

    SPF check:          pass
    DomainKeys check:   neutral
    DKIM check:         pass
    Sender-ID check:    pass
    SpamAssassin check: ham

Once you know everything is working, remove ``t=y`` from the DKIM record.
