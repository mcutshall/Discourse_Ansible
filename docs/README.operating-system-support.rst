Operating system support
************************

I’m primarily interested in CentOS. I’m least interested in Ubuntu. However, I
make an effort to support all of the distributions below.

In some cases, external repositories are used to provide more recent versions of
software. In all cases, PostgreSQL is installed from the ``postgresql.org``
repositories in order to provide an easy upgrade path.

* **CentOS 7**

  - NGINX and Redis are installed from my own GPG-signed repositories.

* **Debian 8 (Jessie)**

  - NGINX is installed from my own GPG-signed repository.

  - Redis is installed from Jessie Backports.

* **Fedora 22**

  - Redis is installed from my own GPG-signed repository.

* **Ubuntu 15.04**

  - NGINX is installed from the ppa:nginx/stable repository.

  - Redis is installed from the ppa:chris-lea/redis repository.
